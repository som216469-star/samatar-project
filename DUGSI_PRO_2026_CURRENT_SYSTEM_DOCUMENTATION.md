# DUGSI PRO 2026 - CURRENT SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION & TECHNICAL AUDIT

**Audit Date:** September 17, 2026  
**System Version:** DUGSI PRO 2026 Enterprise Edition  
**Audit Scope:** Factual inspection of active codebase, modules, APIs, database integration, security posture, and readiness.

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Product Overview
DUGSI PRO 2026 is an institutional Islamic school management and financial accounting software suite built for madrasas, integrated primary/secondary Islamic academies, and Quranic memorization centers. 

The application is structured into two main operational pillars:
1. **Academic & Operational Core (Upgrades Prompt 1):** Student directory, staff & teacher human resources, guardian directory, attendance tracking (student and staff), class/subject management, timetable scheduling, admissions lifecycle, exam scoring, library circulation, inventory asset tracking, and school-wide announcements.
2. **Institutional Financial & Accounting Suite (Upgrades Prompt 2):** Configurable fee structures, invoice generation (single & bulk), payment ledger with receipt issuance, operational expense approvals, non-fee revenue logging, automated payroll calculations, department budgeting with variance analysis, real-time Profit & Loss (P&L), and cash flow tracking.

---

## 2. Technology Stack & Framework Architecture
- **Client Frontend:** React 18+ Single Page Application (SPA), TypeScript, Vite 6.
- **Styling & UI:** Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide React icons, Canvas-confetti, Responsive design.
- **Backend Server:** Node.js, Express.js custom server (`server.ts`) running concurrently with Vite dev middleware on port 3000.
- **Server Bundler:** `esbuild` compiling `server.ts` to CommonJS `dist/server.cjs` for production.
- **Primary Database Client:** `@supabase/supabase-js` v2.49.1 (PostgreSQL Supabase backend).
- **Secondary / Resilient Persistence:** File-based local JSON fallback (`database.json` via native Node `fs` & atomic writes).
- **Export & Document Generation:** Client-side HTML Canvas / Printable DOM window generators for PDF receipts, invoices, payslips, and statements; CSV/Excel text format exporters.
- **Communication Integration:** Direct WhatsApp URI dispatch (`https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=...`).

## 4. Authentication, Authorization & Multi-Tenancy

### Authentication Architecture
- Built-in session auth via Express endpoints: `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/verify`.
- Password hashing using `crypto.scryptSync` with random salt strings.
- Passwords verified on login; existing unhashed passwords automatically upgraded upon next successful login.
- Client stores user session in `localStorage` under `dugsiga_user`.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Supported Roles: `admin`, `teacher`, `accountant`, `staff`.
- Navigation tabs and critical mutations check `user.role`:
  - **Accountant**: Unrestricted access to Finance, Invoices, Fees, Expenses, Budgets, Payroll.
  - **Teacher**: Restricted to assigned Classes, Subjects, Student Attendance, and Grading.
  - **Staff**: Limited to personal attendance, announcements, and asset tracking.
  - **Admin**: Unrestricted access across all operational and administrative modules.

### Multi-Tenancy
- Tenancy model: **Shared Database, Tenant-Partitioned Tables**.
- Every query enforces `eq("school_id", schoolId)` derived from `req.headers["x-school-id"]` or user profile `school_id`.
- Local JSON fallback maintains separate records filtered by `schoolId`.

---

## 7. Finance Calculation Logic & Double-Counting Prevention
- **Invoicing to Fee Sync:** When an invoice is paid or partially paid, the payment is recorded in the payments ledger with an exact `invoice_id` reference.
- **Double Counting Protection:**
  - Revenue calculations in P&L and Cash Flow count **actual cleared payments** (`/api/payments`) plus non-fee income (`/api/income`). Invoices themselves represent accounts receivable and are **not** counted as realized revenue.
  - Payroll expenses: When a payroll entry is marked as `paid`, an automatic expense record is generated in the expense ledger with `category = 'Salaries'` and `notes = 'Payroll for ... [ID: pay-xxxx]'`. The P&L engine references only the expense ledger, avoiding double counting payroll records and expense entries.
- **Cash Flow Reconciliation:**
  - `Opening Balance` is derived from base reserves or initial setting.
  - `Inflows` = Total Payments Received + Total Other Income.
  - `Outflows` = Total Approved/Paid Expenses (inclusive of paid salaries).
  - `Closing Cash Position` = `Opening Balance + Inflows - Outflows`.

---

- **Official Receipts:** Formatted standard thermal or A4 receipts with receipt number, student details, paid amount, remaining balance, and cashier timestamp.
- **Printable Invoices:** Clean tabular invoices displaying school letterhead, student details, line items, discounts, and payment terms.
- **Salary Payslips:** Formal employee payslips with breakdown of basic salary, allowances, deductions, and net pay.
- **WhatsApp Integration:** Instant message formatting with pre-filled student name, invoice number, balance, and custom institution phone numbers.
- **Excel/CSV Data Export:** Built-in tabular export for students, invoices, expenses, payments, and payroll.

## 9. Security & Vulnerability Audit

| Concern | Severity | Observation | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Supabase Service Key on Server** | Low | Kept strictly server-side in `server.ts`; never exposed to Vite bundle. | Maintain strict server-only boundaries. |
| **API Tenant Scoping** | Medium | Requests rely on `x-school-id` header or session token. | Enforce strict JWT token verification on all modern routes in production. |
| **Local Fallback Mode** | Informational | System defaults to `database.json` if Supabase connection fails or credentials are placeholder. | Ensures zero downtime during network or migration interruptions. |
| **Input Validation** | Low | Basic validation present in Express handlers; TypeScript ensures client types. | Implement centralized schema validation (e.g. Zod) across all POST/PUT routes before production migration. |

## 11. Final Gap Analysis & Migration Checklist

### What is Complete:
- Complete frontend UI for all 29 modules.
- End-to-end operational workflows (Invoicing, Receipt generation, Attendance check-in, Payroll calculation, P&L reporting).
- Robust local database fallback (`database.json`) ensuring functional data persistence.
- Zero TypeScript build or bundle errors.

### What Requires Database Migration (Supabase Action):
To move all features from local JSON / expected tables into permanent cloud PostgreSQL, the following SQL tables should be provisioned in Supabase:
1. `dugsiga_teachers`
2. `dugsiga_staff`
3. `dugsiga_guardians`
4. `dugsiga_staff_attendance`
5. `dugsiga_timetable`
6. `dugsiga_admissions`
7. `dugsiga_announcements`
8. `dugsiga_library_books`
9. `dugsiga_library_loans`
10. `dugsiga_inventory`
11. `dugsiga_notifications`
12. `dugsiga_fee_structures`
13. `dugsiga_invoices`
14. `dugsiga_payments`
15. `dugsiga_expenses`
16. `dugsiga_income`
17. `dugsiga_budgets`
18. `dugsiga_payroll`
